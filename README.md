# super-mini-transit-sign
A pocket-sized transit sign, personalized with the arrival times of the Muni lines that I frequent. I utilized data from 511. My original idea for this was to make a keychain gadget, but this is my first hardware project and I didn't realize the complexity of making a portable device. I hope to optimize it for portability in the future! 
## Functionality
Move the joystick left and right to cycle through different stops and their arrival times.
## Parts
- Raspberry Pi Zero W with pre soldered headers
  - Note for beginners: Hammer-on headers exist, but they're a special kind of header. Regular headers need to be soldered on, which I did not know. I originally ordered a headerless Raspberry Pi         with a regular header, thinking I could... hammer it on? That was not the case and I spent many hours in the terminal troubleshooting my pi, when the issue was a detached header all along... lol.
- MicroSD (32GB)
- Adafruit 128x64 OLED Bonnet
